# CODAP-privacy-plugin
This CODAP plugin enhances the educational framework by adding interactive privacy visualizations. It introduces privacy rules (k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness, and differential-privacy), allowing students to explore privacy in datasets. The goal is to make privacy concepts accessible through hands-on, interactive learning.
